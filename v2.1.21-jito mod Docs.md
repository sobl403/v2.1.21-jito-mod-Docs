## Overview
This documentation describes the [Vote Optimized Mod](https://github.com/gabrielhicks/jito-solana-public/commit/060ab96ffa0c6b825ad4690797eb5514eaa32446) for [jito-solana-client v2.1.21](https://github.com/jito-foundation/jito-solana/tree/v2.1.21-jito). The main goal is to reduce the number of Missed Vote Credits before Skipped Slots.

[`run_replay`](https://github.com/gabrielhicks/jito-solana-public/commit/060ab96ffa0c6b825ad4690797eb5514eaa32446#diff-6d8458bb2e53158ac472a9ad4709e6a0a52b75d930c019013298e8acda133828R540-R541)
Before: The validator made voting decisions based on a single vote_bank.
After: With the [threshold voting](https://github.com/gabrielhicks/jito-solana-public/commit/060ab96ffa0c6b825ad4690797eb5514eaa32446#diff-0b654209e209924bfc70e8dd4c84d0979e36b6ca76e85a5899ba4572521a8170R706) feature enabled, improved logic for bank and fork selection is used. Added logic for clearing `Tower` of votes that are on different forks than the selected one, and explicit removal of expired votes (`pop_expired=true`).

#### Logics
A bank store is initialized for which the validator will subsequently vote. If a value exists in the `threshold_ahead_count` field, the last slot the validator voted for is retrieved, and it's checked if a value exists in the `mostly_confirmed_bank` field. If both the value and the last slot voted for by the validator exist, all banks between `most_recent_voted_slot` and `mostly_confirmed_bank_parent` are added to the bank store in the format: `(most_recent_voted_slot, mostly_confirmed_bank_parent]`. Regardless of whether the last voted slot exists, banks in the range from `mostly_confirmed_bank` to `threshold_ahead_count` are added to the bank store.
The following filtering is applied to the banks in the bank store:
1) Banks that have already been voted for are removed.
2) [Locked](https://docs.anza.xyz/implemented-proposals/tower-bft#lockouts) banks are removed.
3) If the `after_skip_threshold` feature is enabled, banks that have not reached `is_mostly_confirmed` or `duplicate_confirmed` (depending on the configuration) are removed.
4) All other banks, except for the first 31 banks not filtered by points 1-3, are removed.
All banks that would increase the lockout count from `mostly_confirmed_slot` to >64 are removed. Newer banks are removed first so that they can be voted for when the lockout is lifted.
If the bank store is empty after applying filtering, it's checked if a value exists in the `threshold_escape_count` field. If so, banks in the range `recent_voted_slot..threshold_escape_count` are selected.
For each vote in the Tower structure, it's checked if `vote.slot()` is an ancestor of our last vote's bank. If not, it's removed, as it is on a different fork.

Before: Processing a single bank.
After: Processing a list of banks.

[`Tower`](https://github.com/gabrielhicks/jito-solana-public/commit/060ab96ffa0c6b825ad4690797eb5514eaa32446#diff-0b654209e209924bfc70e8dd4c84d0979e36b6ca76e85a5899ba4572521a8170R283)
Added fields controlling vote optimization.
Added the [`update_config`](https://github.com/gabrielhicks/jito-solana-public/commit/060ab96ffa0c6b825ad4690797eb5514eaa32446#diff-0b654209e209924bfc70e8dd4c84d0979e36b6ca76e85a5899ba4572521a8170R699) function. No more frequently than once per minute, it checks for the existence of and reads the configuration from the `./mostly_confirmed_threshold` file.
Record format: a b c d, where
- a = `mostly_confirmed_threshold: f64` - confirmation threshold, defaults to 0.38.
- b = `threshold_ahead_count: u8` - allows voting for slots ahead of the slot that reached `mostly_confirmed_threshold`.
- c = `after_skip_threshold: u8` - requirement for the percentage of votes received for a slot after Skipped Slots. 0 - no restrictions, 1 - `is_mostly_confirmed`, 2 - `is_supermajority_confirmed`.
- d = `threshold_escape_count: u8` - The number of slots after which the validator will vote anyway, even if the threshold is not reached, to avoid deadlock situations in the network.
